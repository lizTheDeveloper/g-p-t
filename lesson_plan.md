## Javascript Functions

### Materials:
	Student's Laptop
	https://repl.it/languages/javascript
	[Slides]()

### Requirements:
	Students should be able to:
		Create variables
		Store the result of an expression in a variable
		Use console.log() to see outputs


### Objectives:
* Students will write functions that:
	* execute statements
	* parameters change the behavior of the function
	* have properly scoped variables
	* use the return keyword to return an expression


* Students will be able to call functions:
	* That have no parameters
	* That have one or more parameters
	* By composing other function calls as arguments- eg. sum(sum(5,10), 100)


### Assessments:
Accomplish the following and send it to me:  
(Use https://repl.it/languages/javascript)  

- [ ] Start with by writing a *function* that greets you
- [ ] Modify your function so that it can greet anyone, using a *parameter*
- [ ] Create a function that adds two numbers together, from *arguments*, and then prints the answer (call it **addTwo**)
- [ ] Modify your function so that it can be called as an argument to itself, using the *return* statement
- [ ] Create a program that calculates the average of 6 numbers, using the addTwo function (** use 5, 7, 9, 4, 5, 6 - you should get 6 as a result **) and returns them
- [ ] Calculate the average of 18 numbers (use 5, 7, 9, 4, 5, 6, 19, 22, 33, 26, 27, 30, 44, 44, 45, 44, 46, 41 which is 25.389) and print it using console.log(). Use only function calls, and no variable assignment outside of the function calls.


#### In-Class Questions:
* What happens if we choose to use global variables rather than local variables? What if some other code uses the same variable names you do? (eg. name, location)
* Why don't we just console.log everything, rather than using return?
* What would happen if we tried to call a function inside of another function?
